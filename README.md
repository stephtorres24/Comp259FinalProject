Instructions

Overview:
MotionCraft is a GUI built in Python to facilitate animation control. It allows for basic playback and editing functionalities such as play, pause, stop, and speed adjustment of animations. The program also includes image loading capabilities and preliminary camera movement controls for a comprehensive animation editing experience. 

Requirements:
Python3/Pygame/pygame_gui/Tkinter

Installation:
To set up this interface, make sure you have Python3 installed on your system. 
Then install the necessary packages using pip:
pip3 install pygame pygame_gui
Then for the Tkinter package it typically comes bundled with Python. 
Running the program:
python3 GUI.py or just hit play in your IDE

Features:
Animation Control: Use the Play, Pause, Stop, and Reset buttons to control aniamtion playback. 
Speed Adjustment: A slider allows for a the dynamic adjustment of the animation's speed. 
Camera Movement: Control the camera view with four directional buttons to move left, right, up, and down. 
Image Loading: Load images into the animation space using the Load button. 
Animation Selection: Choose between preset animations such as bouncing ball, rotating square, and scaling triangle. 

How to Use:
Load Animation/Image: Click the load button to import an animation or image. (right now only images functions correctly)
Control Playback: Use the Play, Pause, Stop, and Reset buttons to manage the animation selected.
Adjust Speed: Move the slider to increase or decrease the speed of the animation. 
Move Camera: Use the directional buttons to change the camera's position in the animation space. 
Select Animation: Pick an animation from the dropdown menu to display it. 
Other Two Drop Down Menu's: Just integrated the two buttons for blending purposes which is future work. 

Future Work:
Future updates deal with improving the camera controls, adding functionality to the animation blending features, and properly convert this into SKA projects.
